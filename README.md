Auto Screen Capture

Small and portable automated screen capture utility.

This application enables you to automatically take
screenshots of multiple screens and multiple regions
at a specified interval.

You can schedule your automated screen capture sessions by
specifying when a session starts and when a session ends on
particular days of the week.

A calendar is included to help you keep track of what days
screenshots were taken and you can filter screenshots based
on label or active window title.
