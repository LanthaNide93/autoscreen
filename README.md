# autoscreen
Auto Screen Capture

Small and portable automated screen capture utility.

This C# application enables you to automatically take
screenshots at a chosen interval. For example, you may want to capture
the progress of playing through a game's level or perhaps
just use the application as a digital diary.

You can also schedule your automated screen capture sessions by
specifying when a session starts and when a session ends on
particular days of the week or every day.

A calendar is included to help you keep track of what days
screenshots were taken and a slideshow module can play through
that day's list of screenshots.
